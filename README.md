# Austrian Quant

This repository contains Python-based **quantitative trading algorithms** developed for use with Quantopian (now discontinued). The code here showcases various strategies for backtesting and analyzing financial data, offering insights into algorithmic trading.

## How the Code Works
The trading algorithms rely on financial data processing and backtesting to simulate trades and evaluate performance. The scripts load historical stock data from CSV files, calculate key indicators like moving averages, and generate buy/sell signals based on the strategy defined in the code. For example, the quant1.py script uses a momentum-based strategy, where stocks are bought if they show upward momentum, and sold once certain profit thresholds are met. All trades are backtested using the historical data to evaluate profitability.


## Overview

The project includes several trading algorithms written in Python that focus on financial markets analysis and stock trading. Key strategies utilize historical price data, financial indicators, and backtesting principles to develop profitable trading models. 

## Features
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Scripts that analyze market data and implement trading strategies based on financial indicators.
- **Backtesting**: Algorithms are designed to simulate trades and assess performance using historical data.
- **Custom Strategies**: Custom trading strategies, including basic momentum and mean-reversion techniques, are available to modify and experiment with.

## Dependencies

To use the code in this repository, you will need Python and several key libraries for data analysis and algorithm development, including:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these libraries using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the algorithms, clone the repository and execute one of the strategy scripts:
```sh
python quant1.py
```
Ensure you have all dependencies installed, and input your data (stock prices, financial metrics) in the correct format.

## File Structure
- **quant1.py**: Example algorithm implementing a basic momentum strategy.
- **practice1.py**: A practice file showcasing various financial data manipulations and backtests.
- **/data**: Contains CSV files with stock price data used for backtesting the algorithms.

## How to Contribute
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests with improvements, new strategies, or enhanced documentation.
